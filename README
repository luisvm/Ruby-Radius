Ruby-Radius - RADIUS interface for Ruby
=======================================

This Ruby module provides an interface to the RADIUS protocol.  It
provides these two classes::

  Radius::Packet - Deals with Radius Packets
  Radius::Dictionary - Deals with RADIUS dictionaries

This module's API is based heavily on the Net::Radius Perl module
created by Christopher Masto, Luis Munoz, and Ian Smith.

Garry Dolley and OneLogin, Inc. started the RSpec test suite under the
``test/`` directory and added correct Response Authenticator support
(previous one is believed to be broken).

Installation
------------

Since the module is pure Ruby, to install this all that needs to be
done is to run the 'install.rb' script.

This package supports the use of vendor-specific attributes.  This
type of attribute is defined in RFC 2138 and is used to support
'proprietary' extensions on top of the base RADIUS specification.

The whole API is documented in rdoc-style comments within the source
itself.  If you have extracted this from a distribution tarball, the
documentation should be included ready for you to read within the
'doc' subdirectory.  If you've gotten this from CVS, you need rdoc to
extract the HTML documentation.  Visit the rdoc website at
http://rdoc.sourceforge.net/ for more information.
